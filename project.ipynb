    "## Project Motivation and Idea\n",
    "Considering the enormous amount of money in todays football market, the building of a well-functioning roster with players interacting collaboratively together becomes an incredibly important task with high stakes. Therefore any insight into how a team performs together, which players are the pillars of the team and which players could be replaced for performance enhancement could be worth millions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using network analysis on professional football teams adds something new and remarkable to sports analytics. While normal sports analytics is often about different metrics for evaluating players' performance, without considering the interaction between teammates network analysis might be able to actually extract patterns of play, show interaction between certain sets of players and give us an idea to how certain teams set up their offense. \n",
    "\n",
    "There have been different approaches using network analysis on football teams, however they often fall short.\n",
    "Generally, adjacency matrices are built from all possessions observed. This leads to the defensive and central midfielders almost always showing up as the most important players for each team. This might make sense, since they are often in the center of play, however this is not an interesting or trustworthy find if you claim that the central midfielder is the most important player in every team.\n",
    "In this project, I try to take a different approach by looking only at possessions that ended in a shot. Doing this we take care of two possible problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "i) We only look at possessions where the team actually looked to score. Short possessions in your own half are not considered vital to the overall game. Players that have the ball often in those possessions (defenders, central midfielders and even goalkeepers) will not show up as central, if they do not contribute to offensive play.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii) We can assign a value to each of the possessions using an expected Goals model. This gives us an idea of how big the chance was. This value can be used to assign each of the players a value according to their contribution. The main idea is here: if you create a lot of good chances, you are a good (offensive) player."

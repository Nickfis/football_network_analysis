# Network Analysis for professional football teams in La Liga

In this project I take a look at the offensive networks of all 20 teams in La Liga, using data from the 2017/2018 season. 
All the steps are documented within the Jupyter Notebook. Some data however (like the possessions dataframe and xG-features of every shot) were coded up before and are not part of this project.

The main distinguishment compared to previously done network analysis is due to defining possessions differently, using only plays that ended in a shot, and assigning a certain value to these possessions by using a (self-developed) expected Goals model.
